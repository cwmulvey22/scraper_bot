Explainers, Personal Finance, Reviews & More.\n\nMy friends would ask me finance questions all the time, so I made this channel so I could send them videos answering those questions. I love explaining things simply, and making it fun and easy. This channel is great for beginners and intermediates who are looking to build wealth, learn how to keep their wealth, and get better with personal finance, budgeting, and investing. I also focus a lot of self improvement and productivity, so if you're into that - I hope you stick around!\n\nBusiness inquiries - please email:\ncarina@1stcollab.com\n",
