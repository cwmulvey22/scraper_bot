The less we have to rely on others, the less we may care about their feelings. This leads us to be more self-focused. Another reason has to do with our attitudes towards greed. Like Gordon Gekko, upper-class people may be more likely to endorse the idea that \u201cgreed is good.\u201d Piff and his colleagues found that wealthier people are more likely to agree with statements that greed is justified, beneficial, and morally defensible. These attitudes ended up predicting participants\u2019 likelihood of engaging in unethical behavior.\u201d\n\nSource: How Wealth Reduces Compassion, Scientific American\n\nI share this not to say that we will all become selfish if we become wealthy. It\u2019s to be more hyper-aware of this correlation so that you can catch yourself if you start losing perspective.\n\nIf anything, I\u2019ve become more hyper-aware of how others are suffering. I\u2019ve become more generous with my donating money and helping out family members.\n\nHowever, I come from poverty. I know what it\u2019s like to go without.\n\nWhat if I had been born wealthy?\n\nIt\u2019s not a black-and-white issue but one we should all be aware of.",

That\u2019s your true hourly wage because if you were to outsource those tasks, you\u2019d have to pay someone to do them.\n\nSomehow women have been convinced that household chores is not work and yet most men don\u2019t want to do it. If it\u2019s so easy then you load the dishwasher Chad!\n\nI know it\u2019s easier sometimes to \u201cjust do it yourself\u201d but it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s not your job to be someone\u2019s maid or someone\u2019s cook.\n\nThere are no masculine or feminine chores. There are just chores and guess what? When you\u2019re single, you do them all! So why are we dividing it by gender when we have a partner? Because patriarchy has brainwashed us into thinking this way.\n\nWomen initiate 70% of divorces because we are TIRED. We are tired of having to do it all. Our job, house manager, emotional regulator, etc.\n\nWe don\u2019t like doing dishes either. We don\u2019t like cooking either. But yes we do want a clean home and we\u2019re not going to live in our own filth. So we just do it but that will get old and she will get over having to do twice the cleaning and cooking for no reason.\n\nHave these conversations often when you\u2019re starting to date someone and observe how they act. And if they pull a switcheroo on you and start slacking once they locked you down, then you need to end that relationship for breach of contract and misrepresentation. PERIODT.",
