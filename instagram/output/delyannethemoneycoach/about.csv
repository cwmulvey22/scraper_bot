The less we have to rely on others, the less we may care about their feelings. This leads us to be more self-focused. Another reason has to do with our attitudes towards greed. Like Gordon Gekko, upper-class people may be more likely to endorse the idea that ‚Äúgreed is good.‚Äù Piff and his colleagues found that wealthier people are more likely to agree with statements that greed is justified, beneficial, and morally defensible. These attitudes ended up predicting participants‚Äô likelihood of engaging in unethical behavior.‚Äù\n\nSource: How Wealth Reduces Compassion, Scientific American\n\nI share this not to say that we will all become selfish if we become wealthy. It‚Äôs to be more hyper-aware of this correlation so that you can catch yourself if you start losing perspective.\n\nIf anything, I‚Äôve become more hyper-aware of how others are suffering. I‚Äôve become more generous with my donating money and helping out family members.\n\nHowever, I come from poverty.
