Usually you just work til you\u2019re 65. And then you have a retirement party. And then you just completely stop working.\n\nBut truthfully, there are endless options to design a \u201csemi-retirement\u201d if you have the financial means.\n\nInvesting as much as you can as early as you can is the best way to give yourself the option to potentially \u201csemi-retire\u201d if that interests you.\n\nStroller is @zoestrollers  @zoebabygear\n\n#financialindependence #investing #financialindependenceretireearly #zoefam #rollwithzoe",

But if you\u2019re a bit uncomfortable and you\u2019ve already spent money on going out for your friends birthday, then maybe you\u2019ll question your spending on some unnecessary expense instead of just buying it anyways. \n\nI know this sounds a little Dave Ramsey-ish and I know this isn\u2019t for everyone.

I just knew it was the right thing to do because of the power of compounding.\n\n10 years later and I\u2019m so happy that I invested what I did. It\u2019s given our family a ton of financial security and flexibility.\n\nI was too busy partying at 23 to even know what my life would like 10 years into the future. But now at 33, I can look back and at least share my journey and lessons with you all.\n\nIf you know you want a family in the future, you might as well start thinking a little bit about your financial future now.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be anything crazy, but if you\u2019re wasting $500/month on junk, think about how much financial security and freedom that can provide your future family if you invest that $500 every month and you do that for 10 years.\n\nIt\u2019s sometimes hard to picture that or imagine that far into the future. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so transparent about my finances on social media. So you can see what\u2019s possible if you save/invest like I did. Even if you did half of what I did, you would still have a lot of money.\n\nI\u2019m not telling you to skip that trip with your friends or to eat at home every meal\u2026I just want you to truly think about how you\u2019re spending every dollar and make sure it aligns with you values and your future aspirations. Especially if you want a family.\n\nAlso, this video is 7 months old lol. I just never posted it from my drafts. But it\u2019s cool that my net worth has grown from $540K to $600K in that timeframe.

It\u2019s like free money from your employer. Just make sure you understand the vesting terms. But a 401K match is the only time in your life where you will get a 100% or 50% return on your money.

And I wanted those too.\n\nBut a dollar invested in your 20s is worth SO much more than a dollar invested in your 30s or 40s (when investing for 30-40 years).\n\nSo how do you balance this?\n\nCut back on things that don\u2019t matter to you (in my case, living with roommates, driving a used car, cooking at home, etc.).\n\nSo you can spend money on the things that DO matter to you (experiences, travel, socializing with friends)\u2026AND still have money to invest for your future.\n\nUnless you have an extremely high income, you\u2019re not going to be able to have the nicest apt, a brand new car, doordash dinner and eat out lunch, the fanciest clothes, travel all the time, and still save for retirement.\n\nYou simply can\u2019t have everything, unless you want to work until you\u2019re 70 years old. That\u2019s why you need to prioritize your spending and if experiences/travel are important to you, then prioritize them, but you\u2019re probably going to have to give something else up.",
