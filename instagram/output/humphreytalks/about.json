This might be the explanation\ud83d\udc47\n\nApple employs a very unique business approach called the \u201creverse razor\u201d and no, it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with razors. \n\nIt means that they price the hero product (like their iPhone) very high and make secondary products (like songs) very low. \n\nThis contributed to their initial success when the iPhone was released back in 2007. \n\nThe name \u201creverse razor\u201d comes from the standard practices around selling razors. Companies typically make the razor cheap and the blade super expensive to generate profit. \n\nCan you think of other products that use a similar model? Drop it in the comments.",

This gives the holder much higher voting right weight and allows the investor to attend shareholder meetings.\n\nWarren Buffet wanted to make sure anyone who originally invested in Berkshire Hathaway was high quality. Think of it as a vetting process for investors. \n\nThe problem was\u2026 not a ton of investors could afford the stock. So, in the 90s Buffet opened up the Class B share option.\n\nThis option allows investors to still get a piece of the company but with reduced voting rights and share value. \n\nWhich would you choose?",

On a biweekly payment plan, you\u2019d pay half this amount every two weeks, or 26 payments over a year. This is the equivalent of one extra monthly payment \u2014 13 instead of 12.
